            <p>Risk of Rain 2 (ROR2 for short) progression is rather simple. Upon selecting your difficulty 
                and character, you'll drop right into the action on Stage 1. It is highly advised to read up 
                on your character abilities before jumping into the action, just so you can get a general idea 
                of who you are working with.</p>

                    Various monsters will sprout out of the ground left and right. Killing these monsters rewards you with
                    coins, which you use on the many chests and shrines scattered about the map you are on.

                    Use this money on the goods and they'll grant you a random item which will greatly help you on your
                    journey. These items grant benefits such as increased mobility, damage, area of effect attacks—the list
                    keeps going! Beating ROR2 without items is hopeless, so grab as many as you can!

                    Be swift, though, because you're on a timer. If you point your gaze towards the top-right corner, you'll spot
                    the difficulty you selected previously as well as a bar beneath it. This bar will gradually go up to
                    harder difficulties, making the game harder the longer you play. Be sure to grab plenty items, but not
                    waste time doing so!

                    Once you feel ready, find the teleporter on the map and activate it. This will summon a boss for you to
                    conquer. Finish charging the teleporter to 100% by staying in its red radius and you'll be able to 
                    proceed to Stage 2. Rinse and repeat this process until you reach Stage 6, the final boss.
