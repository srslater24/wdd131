      <p>"As a major fan of a game known as 'Risk of Rain 2', I understand the game is vastly difficult to 
        understand when it comes to various secrets or unlockables. The purpose of this website is to provide an easy guide to 
        these unlockables. (This is a continuation/revamp of my WDD 130 final, where I had the same premise.)"</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>New Risk of Rain 2 players who require guidance on progression.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Dynamic Elements</h3>
      <p>In my previous version of the site, most of what I was adding had to be tediously added into the html. 
        this time around, since we learned about javascript, I can easily make a format that will allow easy replication of several 
        elements that will be alike.</p> <!-- change this -->

        Risk of Rain 2 is an incredibly entertaining game, and if you're looking at this website then you want to learn more about how
        to progress in it. Let's get the ball rolling right away!

        Risk of Rain 2 (ROR2 for short) progression is rather simple. Upon selecting your difficulty and character, you'll drop right
        into the action on Stage 1. Various monsters will sprout out of the ground left and right. Killing these monsters rewards you with
        coins, which you use on the many chests and shrines scattered about the map you are on. Use this money on the goods and they'll
        grant you a random item which will greatly help you along the game. These items grant benefits such as increased mobility, damage,
        area of effect attacks, the list keeps going! Beating ROR2 without items is hopeless, so grab as many as you can!

        Be swift, though, because you're on a timer. If you point your gaze towards the top-right corner, you'll spot the difficulty you
        selected previously as well as a bar beneath it. This bar will gradually go up to harder difficulties, making the game harder
        the longer you play. Be sure to grab plenty items, but not waste time doing so!

        Once you feel ready, find the teleporter on the map and activate it. This will summon a boss for you to conquer. Once done, 
        finish charging the teleporter to 100% by staying in it's red radius and you'll be able to proceed to Stage 2.

        Rinse and repeat this process until you reach Stage 6, the final boss. Charge the 4 pillars, go to the arena, and fight for your
        life. Should you emerge victorious, make a mad dash for the entrance of the stage and charge the dropship before leaving.

      <h3>Items</h3>
      <p>
        Topic: Unlockables (Items)

        Risk of Rain 2 has a large repertoire of items to aid you in your journey. These items all have different functions and uses,
        many of said items stuck behind an unlock. Below is a guide to unlocking all of the ROR2 items which require a prerequisite in order
        to encounter them in your future runs, alongside helpful tips which may make unlocking these easier.

        [In the actual website, I'll include a few items of each rarity with tips for unlocking each of them.
        It would be too ambitious to list every single item in this huge game, so for the sake of time, I'll
        condense it to a limited amount of items.]
